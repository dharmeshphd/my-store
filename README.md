## Note
1. I used REST Client extension of VS Code for testing REST APIs (It is far more managable extension then POSTMAN)
2. API requests collection for REST Client extension (postman) is stored in "http_client : postman" directory
3. Some error handling in frontend and backend is still remaining. 
4. Most of routes on backend is protected, but it is possible to some may be still remained.
5. This is demo project and considering that the authantication system is simpler.
6. In real projects the authanication system must be more advaced then this.
