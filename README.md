Practical Test Project

MOST IMPORTANT (HOW TO MAKE ADMIN USER)
* ACCESS ADMIN PANEL
* ADMIN PREVELEGE ONLY BE GIVEN BY DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR
* Create a user from app
* Go to mongodb shell
* Find that user
* Change the permission by => user.peresmission.admin = true
* Only these user has access to admin panel and able to see all the users.


Step 1: Install node modules 

Note : 
1. App is configured with local database (mongodb), please change the mongodb URI to perform futher operations
2. I used REST Client extension of VS Code for testing REST APIs (It is far more managable extension then POSTMAN)
3. API requests collection for REST Client extension (postman) is stored in "http_client : postman" directory
